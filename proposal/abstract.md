## Statistical data cleaning using R

Proposal for a 3 hour workshop on statistical data cleaning.

Mark van der Loo and Edwin de Jonge, Statistics Netherlands


### Instructors

Mark van der Loo is a researcher at Statistics Netherlands: the Dutch national
authority for Official Statistics. In this role he has authored several R packages,
including 'stringdist', 'validate', 'lumberjack' and 'tinytest'. Mark has over
15 years of experience in teaching R and is currently an associate editor for the
R journal.

Edwin de Jonge is a researcher at Statistics Netherlands focusing on
complexity theory, statistical computing, visualisation and data cleaning.
Edwin has published a number of widely used R packages including 'whisker',
'errorlocate', 'daff', 'chunked', and 'ffbase'. In 2018 John Wiley & Sons
published the book 'Statistical Data Cleaning with Applications in R' 
that he authored together with Mark van der Loo.



### Abstract.

To trust the outcome of a statistical analyses, one must be able to trust the
input data. 

In this workshop we demonstrate how data quality can be systematically defined
and improved using R. Starting from raw data, we treat technical cleaning
such as string cleaning and type conversion. This is followed by techniques
to detect, report on, and fix inconsistencies and impossibilities in data.
Next, we treat imputation methods for handling missing data and adapting
data to satisfy constraints imposed by domain knowledge. Finally, methods
for automated monitoring of data quality throughout a process will be 
discussed.

Participants wil learn how to systematically think about data quality
in different stages of a data analysis. They will also learn how to
define data quality requirements and apply them to data accross various
stages of their data analyses. They will be able to identify the packages
relevant to the data cleaning task at hand and have some experience
using them.

The course will treat packages 'stringdist', 'validate', 'validatetools',
'errorlocate', 'simputation', 'rspa' and 'lumberjack'.  Special attention will
be payed on how to combine the various data processing steps, and how to
analyze and visualize the results.

This tutorial is based on the book 'Statistical Data Cleaning with Applications
in R' (John Wiley & Sons, 2018) by the authors of this tutorial.

### Audience

This tutorial is aimed users who are comfortable with basic R usage. In
particular, participants are expected to be familiar with reading data, data
frames, and creating simple summary statistics and plots.  Participants should
be comfortable with using R scripts, and we hightly recommend working with
RStudio Projects.




### Outline of the tutorial

The tutorial consists of 7 short sections covering Reading Dirty Data,
Approximate Text Matching, Data Validation, Error Localization, Imputation,
Adjusting, and Monitoring.

In each section of the tutorial, participants start by doing a few hands-on
exercises, that consist of running a script line by line, together with a
partner or in a small (breakout) group. Participants are asked to discuss
the results amongst each other and make small changes to the scripts.

After the initial exercise, we have a short plenary session where the groups
give feedback, and the instructors treat the assignment just made. Next,
the experience just gained is put into context by treating the theory
behind them in some more depth. After this, there is a more challenging
exercise on the same topic.
